<h1>Amit D. Rana</h1>
<h2>Professional Summary</h2>
<p>I am a System Administrator & DevOps Engineer with 5+ years of experience managing IT infrastructure, cloud platforms, and enterprise systems. Over the years, I have built a strong foundation in AWS services, automation, containerization, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring solutions, and network security.</p>

<p>My career has been shaped by handling end-to-end infrastructure responsibilities— from provisioning servers and configuring firewalls to setting up cloud-native deployments with Docker, Jenkins, and AWS ECS. I thrive on problem-solving, reducing downtime, and implementing automation that saves time and boosts productivity.</p>

<h2>Career Objective</h2>
<p>My objective is to leverage my expertise in DevOps practices, cloud infrastructure, and security to design scalable and resilient systems. I aim to contribute to organizations by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Driving automation in deployment and monitoring</li>
  <li>Designing secure, cost-efficient AWS architectures</li>
  <li>Building reliable CI/CD pipelines for faster, error-free releases</li>
  <li>Supporting teams with technical guidance, troubleshooting, and process optimization</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, I want to grow into a DevOps Lead / Cloud Architect role, where I can mentor teams, build large-scale cloud solutions, and help businesses achieve high availability, security, and performance in their IT operations.</p>
